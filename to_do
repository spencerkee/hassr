-check for duplicates in item_list, add to read_data function
DONE transitive reduction function
DONE add text coloring
DONE add (n)ew item switch feature
DONE pickeling
-set modes to different colors?
-print mode more clearly
DONE -add move counting
DONE minmax sorting
-change warning placement, currently it's hard to see
-change cli arguments from boolean, currently unclear
-need to remove skipped from total comparisons
-total comparisons left will repeatedly print if there are multiple remaining items without comparisons
-clean up imports?
DONE -sort_by_minmax probably called too much
-remove_relatives and minmax are forcasting different numbers, minmax not estimating properly (should show best and worse case)
-possibly estimate which choice will be taken based on an item profile?
-if something is added to skipped, it's removed from total pairs and minmax gives different answers?
-look into functionality of read_data. May fault if there are more than one blank lines. It should go line by line instead of reading the whole file. Also rename to something more accurate
-implement different presentation methods: traversing longest path, slot filling
-create directory if none is found?
